It has achieved all-round socio-economic progress since its Independence. India has become self-sufficient in agricultural production and is now one of the top industrialised countries in the world and one of the few nations to have gone into outer space to conquer nature for the benefit of the people. It covers an area of 32,87,263 square kilometer, extending from the snow-covered Himalayan heights to the tropical rain forests of the south. As the 7th largest country in the world, India stands apart from the rest of Asia, marked off as it is by mountains and the sea, which give the country a distinct geographical entity. Bounded by the Great Himalaya's in the north, it stretches southwards and at the Tropic of Cancer, tapers off into the Indian Ocean between the Bay of Bengal on the east and the Arabian Sea on the west. Lying entirely in the northern hemisphere, the mainland extends between latitudes 8 degrees, 4 minutes and 37 degrees, 6 minutes North, longitudes 68 degrees, 7 minutes and 97 degrees, 25 minutes East and measures about 3,214 kilometer  from north to south between the extreme latitudes and about 2,933 kilometer from east to west between the extreme longitudes. It has a land frontier of about 15,200 kilometer.
